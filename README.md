## Introduction

My name is Peyton Bechard and I am a self-taught developer with about 2 years of experience. I'm currently looking to make the transition from CS education to a software developer role. Have a look through my repositories and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything that you see here.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of full-stack web development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Javascript leading into more about Node.js and then React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience teaching CS in China and working as a tour manager in North Korea!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peyton-bechard/) or Instagram (@pmbech)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also a synthesizer enthusiast and try to make at least one short track every day.
