# Peyton Bechard

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peyton Bechard and I am a self-taught developer with about 2 years of experience. I'm currently looking to make the transition from CS education to a software developer role. Have a look through my repositories and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything that you see here.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Node.js, and React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience teaching CS in China and working as a tour manager in North Korea!
